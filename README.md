# Rooftop Detection using YOLOv8 - Energy Service Project

This repository contains the final project for the *Energy Services* course at **Instituto Superior Técnico**. The project focuses on rooftop detection from aerial imagery using the YOLOv8 object detection model. 

## 📚 Project Description

Accurate detection of rooftops in aerial or satellite imagery can support a range of energy applications, including:

- **Solar potential estimation**
- **Energy efficiency planning**
- **Urban infrastructure analysis**

This project leverages the YOLOv8 architecture to detect rooftops from annotated images. It involves training, validation, and testing of models on a curated dataset of aerial images, with the goal of producing a reliable detection system for rooftop analysis.

## 👨‍💻 Authors

- **Tomás Arêde**
- **João Santos**
- **Diogo Franco**

## 🗂 Dataset

The dataset used for training and evaluation is a combination of custom data and publicly available annotated rooftop images. A significant portion of the dataset was taken from:

🔗 [AIRS Dataset for Roof Top Detection (Kaggle)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/chandru0503/airs-dataset-for-roof-top-detection-yolov8/data?select=dataset)

This dataset provides high-resolution aerial images along with YOLOv8-compatible annotations.
